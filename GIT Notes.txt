ex: dev1.0                             release_dev1.0            bugfix_dev1.0#1          future_dev1.0

******************Web Hooks**************

what are the ways we have to automate the Jenkins job? --> 3 different ways we have to automate the build process
1.Using the GIT Web Hooks
2.PollSCM in Jenkins
3.Build periodically in Jenkins
Purpose of Web Hooks is to automate the Jenkins jobs
Basically developers will write web hooks for each change and build to be run and 
according to the web hook rule when developer push the code to the repo then automatically Jenkins will run the job
